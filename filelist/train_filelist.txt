../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_M007.wav|No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M002.wav|Must be them then?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro05/Ses01M_impro05_M028.wav|I know what you guys do when you're not working you're union people; you just sit around on your ass.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F026.wav|Did you ask Annie yet?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_M016.wav|They'll find me anyway.  You know they will.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_F007.wav|It's going to be really rough.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_M021.wav|No.  Nothing like that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_F029.wav|oh.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_M016.wav|Wait a minute, I got it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M034.wav|We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_F031.wav|Why?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_M007.wav|You're going to have to get like a nine millimeter because U.S.C.'s like in South Central.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro02/Ses01M_impro02_F011.wav|Me?  I'm not worried about me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M034.wav|Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M036.wav|I want you now, Annie.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_F011.wav|It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F007.wav|It's after eleven; let's go home.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M006.wav|What of it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F020.wav|With your driver's license and your passport.  Just like everybody else.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_F041.wav|I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro06/Ses01M_impro06_M010.wav|Just like it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F016.wav|Do you remember the last time we came here?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M020.wav|I know it was, I don't know I was really nervous but I'm really - I'm really glad.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_F035.wav|Well, um, is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M024.wav|I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M013.wav|Okay.  But how do I--that's- that's not proof to me.  How do I know that, you know, that it's really you.  I need--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M030.wav|For real?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F010.wav|Explain the situation to them and then you can stay here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M024.wav|Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F015.wav|Do you remember the first time we came to see it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_F009.wav|Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F025.wav|Hope for some things.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F009.wav|It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro07/Ses05F_impro07_F000.wav|So guess what.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_M003.wav|Yes, I do.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro05/Ses01F_impro05_M025.wav|It's a gift.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M005.wav|You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro07/Ses04M_impro07_F011.wav|Oh, you did not just say that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro05/Ses01F_impro05_M029.wav|Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro02/Ses03M_impro02_F032.wav|Honey I can't do it anymore.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F008.wav|There is no point in coming down here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F022.wav|No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_1/Ses04F_script03_1_M001.wav|I wonder.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_M010.wav|It's strange; things that ought to matter dreadfully, they just don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F030.wav|Geez.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro07/Ses03M_impro07_M025.wav|It took them, oh man, it took them like, I mean what it's like April now and any letters that come in April are usually the rejection letters so I was just like...
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M016.wav|What does that mean?  Me above all?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_M015.wav|All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M045.wav|Yeah?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_F006.wav|What was he doing out there at that hour?  He's getting just like after Larry died, walking around at night.  He dreams.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M009.wav|Yes, me too, bored stiff. You want some Brandy?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F006.wav|Look,
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M034.wav|I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_F005.wav|I don't have any of them over here.  You're gonna have to go get in that line over there.  And they will give you a copy of the form.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F022.wav|Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_F016.wav|I'll never forgive you for waiting so long.  All I did was sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking about you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_M003.wav|If you really want to do it-I mean,
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F022.wav|What?  Dancing barefoot in the sand?  Drinking out of a bottle of champagne?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro01/Ses04F_impro01_M016.wav|Uhh, and you spelled your own name wrong.  So I need you to take that
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F018.wav|So, yeah, I mean, it'll be good.  We wanna like, uh, I think we're gonna have it in spring time, like early Spring--So it's no too hot yet.  And um--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro08/Ses05F_impro08_F011.wav|Okay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M052.wav|I am thinking like that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F023.wav|Well, thank you very much.  You've been very helpful.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro05/Ses02F_impro05_M007.wav|I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M015.wav|Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_M013.wav|That's a nice point of view, I must say.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F031.wav|I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_F020.wav|That's the wind.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro04/Ses03M_impro04_M024.wav|Yeah.  It's alright.  But--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_F011.wav|Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05b/Ses03M_impro05b_M015.wav|Of course I had my name tags on the luggage.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F000.wav|It's the first year of your child's life.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro04/Ses01M_impro04_M001.wav|It's--I've been trying to find this job I can't get any job.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_F012.wav|I don't, it's just stupid.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_2/Ses04M_script01_2_F007.wav|Now listen, kid. Now, listen.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_1/Ses03M_script02_1_F003.wav|It's ours.  Mine too.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_M008.wav|Why not?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M003.wav|I just don't see how they can make you leave when you have a new baby - we have a new kid.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_M010.wav|No, No, I'm really looking forward to it.  You know how long -- I have been talking about this forever, right? right?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro04/Ses03M_impro04_M018.wav|-they're evicting me from my apartment.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_1/Ses03M_script02_1_M041.wav|Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro06/Ses03F_impro06_F010.wav|It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F010.wav|Yes.  I mean just that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_M036.wav|Turn it off. It's driving me mad.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_F002.wav|Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M027.wav|Because it is.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F016.wav|You started to write me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_1/Ses04F_script03_1_F022.wav|Which particular one?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_M027.wav|Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro07/Ses04M_impro07_F010.wav|It's all about the connections
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_F011.wav|This is humiliating.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_1/Ses05F_script03_1_F006.wav|Behave exquisitely.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M001.wav|I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_M024.wav|Of course.  I told them right away.  We called them all right them.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_F027.wav|Because you mustn't feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have, Chris, do you understand, everything

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F029.wav|It was ridiculous.  Completely ridiculous.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_M037.wav|-and so... yeah.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M001.wav|Ok.  I've- I've just been talking to this machine for the past half hour and I can't-can't get anything done.  I've been trying to book this vacation this entire time.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F017.wav|Why?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M012.wav|All right.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro01/Ses02M_impro01_M016.wav|But my driver's license - I had to have my birth certificate to get my driver's license in the first place right, I mean this - here is my driver's license so

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M010.wav|We'll see them this time.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_M001.wav|She's doing fine. She just took her first steps today actually. I videotaped it for you so you can watch it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F027.wav|Of course, of course--you'll be able to be a part of it.  You can come help me pick my colors.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_F019.wav|No, what is it?  Is your mother?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_M013.wav|We're going to be in the middle of the wilderness. These kind of things happen
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M017.wav|I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_M035.wav|Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F015.wav|I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F006.wav|Look, we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to be like.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F003.wav|Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F035.wav|I didn't say that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_F033.wav|No, I don't. I'm not like that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05a/Ses03M_impro05a_M011.wav|Eight.  And they're all gone.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_F014.wav|I guess the money shouldn't matter to me, but--Somehow it does.  You know? It's not like I do it for the money, but
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F003.wav|I don't think so.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M031.wav|Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F007.wav|Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M061.wav|Oh, thanks.  I'll need it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_F001.wav|What flashlight?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F016.wav|So you know like late dinner and champagne and what not.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M004.wav|You must admit, he was in love with you, wasn't he?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro05/Ses01F_impro05_M023.wav|Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F008.wav|What do you mean dishonest?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_M027.wav|Right.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F036.wav|Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F007.wav|What?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M033.wav|No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M019.wav|You know, Official documentation--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F028.wav|It's so girly.  I don't even know how to like--It's so weird, but it'll be fun.  My mom will love to be like--she'll get so into it, I'm sure.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_M009.wav|Oh, well, yeah of course.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M043.wav|Maybe if you were with somebody else too?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F012.wav|For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F004.wav|I don't care. It's still fish to me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_F009.wav|That's my point.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro05/Ses01M_impro05_F004.wav|There's no need for you to raise your voice, sir.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M027.wav|Yes they do.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro05/Ses02F_impro05_M013.wav|Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_M030.wav|We were very much younger then.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_M028.wav|All right.  Bye, bye.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_M009.wav|Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F000.wav|Look at this, goose bumps.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F016.wav|Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_M000.wav|What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_F035.wav|It's just like- it's a matter of-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_F035.wav|Yeah.  I hadn't actually thought about the cake yet, but
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_F015.wav|Okay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F013.wav|Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F012.wav|I'm very sorry.  I understand you're frustrated. You just got off of a flight.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_F037.wav|You just did not ask me on a date to Red Lobster.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro06/Ses04M_impro06_M013.wav|there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_F010.wav|Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F019.wav|No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08a/Ses03M_impro08a_M012.wav|Um- Let me connect you to my supervisor.  Actually, he's out right now so I'm supervisor until he comes back. Um-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro01/Ses03M_impro01_F010.wav|No, no, no. Sir,you need to get out of the line--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M036.wav|Oh.  That's very amusing indeed.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F001.wav|Yeah.  I know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M020.wav|So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_F025.wav|I'm just so excited to start my life.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_F020.wav|Acting Pants? So what are you going to do? Are you--you're be--you're going to stay here, right?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_F020.wav|Yeah, it's stressful.  I recognize that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_F013.wav|Maybe [garbage].
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro08/Ses04F_impro08_F017.wav|Sir, I don't think my name is really relevant-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_M010.wav|I'll get you- I'll get you a bottle of mace.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_F018.wav|Honey, I'm going to come back. It's not like that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F005.wav|Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M041.wav|Then you help me stay here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_M040.wav|You know, actually now that you mention it, no I don't.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_F039.wav|Turn it on again, please.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M035.wav|I'm doing the best I can.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M004.wav|I guess he is.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M023.wav|Are you going to do it in town or are you out of town?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_M042.wav|What have we got here?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_2/Ses05F_script03_2_F008.wav|I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro01/Ses05M_impro01_F009.wav|I know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_1/Ses05F_script03_1_M010.wav|Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_2/Ses04F_script01_2_F015.wav|Laugh, laugh at me, but why did that happen the very night she came back?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M041.wav|I don't know.  It seemed like a pretty good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you have of the moon from here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_M013.wav|This is stupid.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M001.wav|Well, I finally did it
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro06/Ses03F_impro06_F000.wav|Okay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_M023.wav|Uh huh, yea, lost some of my possessions, yes, so if I lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carry-on
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_F018.wav|So is there any- I mean what if they spend something again?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_F007.wav|Well umm- actually they--I was promoted.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_F018.wav|Uh huh, Okay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro07/Ses03M_impro07_M024.wav|This is going to be so great.  I have so many great ideas.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_M023.wav|yeah.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F006.wav|Behave exquisitely.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M026.wav|That's what the cost of the ticket was for.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro01/Ses05F_impro01_M010.wav|There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_2/Ses01M_script01_2_M014.wav|calm yourself.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_F028.wav|Oh, did you?  I didn't know that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_M019.wav|You want me to go get some champagne?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro01/Ses04F_impro01_M009.wav|What I need you to do is go to the back of the line,
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_M046.wav|Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F004.wav|I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro01/Ses02M_impro01_F009.wav|Well, it's actually-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M036.wav|No, I know. But I know I don't make you happy.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F014.wav|We only cover fifty do-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro02/Ses03M_impro02_M001.wav|Hey.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M000.wav|It's not fair.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro05/Ses01M_impro05_M009.wav|My bag from Atlanta.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F022.wav|Which particular one?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_M035.wav|No, I know. Me neither.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M039.wav|I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F015.wav|Well, that's your business, Chris.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M033.wav|We were very much younger then.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_F010.wav|Oh really?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M030.wav|They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_F029.wav|But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro03/Ses03F_impro03_F001.wav|I- Yeah, it's-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_F016.wav|I mean, I could go to law school, but I'm just not passionate about it, you know? Like I'm not--it doesn't drive me, it doesn't motivate me. I--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_F010.wav|a part left than I can do.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08b/Ses03M_impro08b_F011.wav|Okay no.  Sir, this is the deal.  My phone isn't working and I don't care what the problem is but it needs to work.  That's why I'm paying you guys to fix it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_M018.wav|What else can we do?  I -- we don't have a choice in this.  Do you understand?  You can't come with me and I can't stay here.  That's all there is to it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro05/Ses04F_impro05_F000.wav|You guys lost my bag.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M011.wav|I'll have a little, I think.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F029.wav|Do shut up. Shut up.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M038.wav|Turn it off!

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_F023.wav|Dancing on the beach barefoot, drinking champagne from the bottle.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro02/Ses05F_impro02_M032.wav|I don't know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M043.wav|I am thinking that way.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_M024.wav|It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M029.wav|They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro05/Ses02F_impro05_M020.wav|All right, Miss, I-I know.  I realize this. But Like I said, there are several people that are in your same situation, so, um, it's not--it's not totally uncommon and I'm actually gonna have to ask you to move so I can help the next person.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F011.wav|Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F029.wav|Who do you think you are?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro05/Ses03F_impro05_F005.wav|Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro03/Ses03F_impro03_F018.wav|like a loser, I cried.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M007.wav|What about me?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_1/Ses05F_script03_1_F023.wav|Oh, thank you dear.  And the same goes for you except that if I so much as see you looking at another woman, I'll kill you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M026.wav|I don't get it, the first time we came out here, you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didn't notice it until you got into the car.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_M009.wav|And what about me?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M010.wav|I have no imagination that's all I know to tell you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F026.wav|Absolutely. Thank you so much for calling and we hope that you will come to us again.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_F002.wav|Yep.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M033.wav|Better turn that off I think.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M015.wav|Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M012.wav|Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F033.wav|...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro05/Ses05M_impro05_M018.wav|Well, I don't care if it's legal.  It's happened.  It's already done.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M035.wav|Amanda, listen, listen.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_F031.wav|and if we survive, if we survive that then babe, you know you know we could survive any--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro04/Ses01M_impro04_M000.wav|I'm just mad.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M029.wav|Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_F015.wav|Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_1/Ses03M_script02_1_F009.wav|That's my point.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_F018.wav|I have to wait a few weeks for people come go through my things to get the money back that I didn't spend?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F001.wav|Um, I don't know, where?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F015.wav|Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro02/Ses05F_impro02_F001.wav|um.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_M020.wav|That's what it is?  Right?  You want this to be like the other time, right?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M050.wav|Or not.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M019.wav|It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F003.wav|Now and always, my sweet.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M012.wav|We'll see them this year.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_1/Ses04F_script03_1_F010.wav|Yes, meaning just that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro06/Ses01M_impro06_M025.wav|Umm...
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro03/Ses03F_impro03_F010.wav|and he just starts doing like this little spiel about me and like
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_F013.wav|you know if I laugh at everything then I must laugh at us, too.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_M011.wav|Darling, don't say that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro04/Ses04F_impro04_M006.wav|Look bananas don't grow overnight.  Okay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_F013.wav|It's become a habit with you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro04/Ses01M_impro04_F001.wav|How come?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05b/Ses03M_impro05b_M022.wav|Who are you going to fire because of that?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro08/Ses04F_impro08_F004.wav|Sir, can- can you tell me which branch you went to.  We can start there.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_M020.wav|Oh yes.  .
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro06/Ses05F_impro06_F029.wav|yeah yeah.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F046.wav|Hmm.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_F015.wav|No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_F032.wav|Are you crazy?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F014.wav|No but that's an awesome school. That's so cool.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro05/Ses01F_impro05_M009.wav|Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_F006.wav|Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_M006.wav|How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M032.wav|And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_M014.wav|Yeah, absolutely.  Hello?  You know me.  I go to bars all the time.  Like, they all know me, you know.  But no one wants to hire me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_F001.wav|I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M011.wav|No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M001.wav|Come on, what?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_F016.wav|Oh whose they?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M001.wav|He was out here when it broke.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_F012.wav|There is no point.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_1/Ses04F_script03_1_F006.wav|Behave exquisitely.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_M031.wav|They snap.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_F011.wav|You can't say that to him.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_M002.wav|Must be them then.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_F050.wav|You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F024.wav|No. What is it?  Is it your mother?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F031.wav|I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro06/Ses04M_impro06_F003.wav|I'm sorry.  It's never easy.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_2/Ses05F_script03_2_F015.wav|It's the woman's job to allure the man.  Why don't you watch me for a moment?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M039.wav|I I want you now, Annie.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro03/Ses01M_impro03_F022.wav|How exciting.  You should make her bring all your friends too.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_F013.wav|You can't say that to him.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_M025.wav|Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy.  You're our customer.  You're the most important thing. Okay?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M037.wav|No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_2/Ses05F_script01_2_M015.wav|Why me, above all?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro06/Ses04F_impro06_M006.wav|you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro05/Ses01M_impro05_F016.wav|I had nothing to do with the boarding attendance.  I'm sorry that your seat was wherever it was.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_F029.wav|No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M014.wav|You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro04/Ses01M_impro04_F022.wav|I'm just saying that maybe you should take in some information before you produce more of your own.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro01/Ses01M_impro01_F011.wav|What do you expect me to do?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_F035.wav|[LAUGHTER]. Oh, Joe, I'm so happy.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M039.wav|Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_F008.wav|There is no point in coming down here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_M021.wav|yeah.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_F012.wav|I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_F040.wav|This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro03/Ses01M_impro03_F000.wav|What?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M006.wav|How you doing? You know what I forgot? I forgot to bring my flashlight. How - how could I forget to bring my flashlight? How could I be so stupid?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F030.wav|And your bag is not my concern.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_F004.wav|You knew there was nothing in that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M013.wav|We've gotta say it to him.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_M018.wav|I wonder if they can hear me talking, you know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_M023.wav|She is not Larry's girl!
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro06/Ses01F_impro06_M015.wav|Mmhmm.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_M032.wav|Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_M014.wav|Huh?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_F002.wav|Oh, we're not hiring at this time or thank you, we already have your information on file--We'll call you when we're ready.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_1/Ses05F_script03_1_M016.wav|No, that fire will fade along with our passion.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_F001.wav|Okay. Before I get into it, um your menu or whatever like where you choose the different thing depending on the-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_M028.wav|Not a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people.  So, like four of us total, right?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_F001.wav|There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_M014.wav|It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatized over.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M024.wav|You- you- you- you're misunderstanding me.  You're going to do that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M019.wav|Oh Annie, we are going to live now.  I am going to make you so happy.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_F010.wav|What do you want to do, argue with him?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_F004.wav|Not at all. It was very pretty. I still wear it often.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M011.wav|You understand?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_F034.wav|Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_F012.wav|I just don't.  It's stupid.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_F026.wav|No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F015.wav|I know, but he doesn't know that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F024.wav|Yes, I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M001.wav|So you're not sorry you came?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_M023.wav|No, no, no, it's cool.  It's cool.  It's cool.  So, um
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_F000.wav|Hey, how's it going, Joe?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M008.wav|Whose is it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05a/Ses03M_impro05a_F020.wav|calm.  Sir, okay basically what- what's going to happen here is you're going to give me your contact information and we will contact you--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F020.wav|Yeah.  Yeah, of course.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M025.wav|Horrible thing.  I hated it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro06/Ses02M_impro06_F012.wav|Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_M032.wav|I love you.  Okay?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F047.wav|You can't do that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M013.wav|For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro08/Ses04F_impro08_F024.wav|Okay.  If that's what you want, you want to go to the next person?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08b/Ses03M_impro08b_F006.wav|No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_M039.wav|Yeah?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro05/Ses01M_impro05_F011.wav|Details, Details.  Well, anyhow can I--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M041.wav|But that's not going to-- But you don't understand. You're looking forward to never seeing me again.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_M015.wav|Right. You can go online, print it out, and just fill out the form and um- send it to us um- you know,  regarding the grievance and-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro07/Ses05F_impro07_F008.wav|Whoa.  What an idea.  Where would you want to live?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro07/Ses04M_impro07_M008.wav|Yeah.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_F044.wav|pig
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M002.wav|I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_F000.wav|Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M017.wav|Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F016.wav|It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_M006.wav|Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_F006.wav|Well kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.

And provide us with your information while you're here and then, maybe, if it turns up, then we'll send it right over.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F022.wav|I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_F006.wav|No.  I'm just working in restaurants and stuff. But, I'm also trying to audition and what not.  So, it's --
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F021.wav|Yeah, sure.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M014.wav|Right.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_M005.wav|I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_M009.wav|I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M043.wav|So what do you think?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M015.wav|Nothing.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_F011.wav|It's after eleven, let's go home.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F024.wav|And do you still feel that way?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F021.wav|I can't help it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_M012.wav|I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_M024.wav|No.  It doesn't.  And you can't think like that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_M022.wav|but, it's gonna be fine.  I'm gonna be fine.  You know I'm good at this.  I can do this.  That's why I trained all this time.  I'm good at this.  Okay?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_F011.wav|but you're gonna have to go get in  that line to
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F006.wav|Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro04/Ses03M_impro04_F026.wav|What?  You can't...what?  Now come on.  Stop it.  Don't be talking like that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_M019.wav|Oh no.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F027.wav|I'm finding a way to make it work.  And I will go wherever you go.  Whatever I have to do, I will make this work.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F042.wav|Alright but you can't talk like that you hear?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_M036.wav|And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_1/Ses02M_script03_1_M001.wav|I wonder.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_2/Ses01F_script01_2_M008.wav|How do you know why she waited?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_F000.wav|Is it them?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M009.wav|Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F012.wav|Well, I can give you my Social Security Number.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro06/Ses01M_impro06_F025.wav|That's a long time.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F028.wav|Yeah, and very much sillier.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M004.wav|Are we talking about the same thing?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F016.wav|Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F018.wav|Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_M013.wav|Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F007.wav|Oh my Gosh. I thought there was like, maybe going to be some, like I don't know if you are going to get in or not, so I'm really glad that you did.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M045.wav|I guess that included you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_2/Ses01F_script01_2_M017.wav|What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_F023.wav|We didn't see them the year before either.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_F023.wav|I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F008.wav|But I'm going to definitely have to- uh--get your contact information
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_F029.wav|Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro02/Ses01M_impro02_F010.wav|What about the birthday party?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F028.wav|Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08a/Ses03M_impro08a_F032.wav|In fact, give me your name sir, what's your name again?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro06/Ses03F_impro06_F025.wav|Just seems so unfair, is the way it is.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F036.wav|I won't.  Let go, let go of me. Listen, listen?  I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F003.wav|What are we to do?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F041.wav|Yeah, I can see that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F019.wav|No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_F043.wav|I'm so sorry.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F004.wav|Don't go.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_M011.wav|What if I pay you money?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F018.wav|No, you've got to believe.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_M004.wav|I'll come back we'll have, you know, some good benefits from being in the service and then we'll live - we'll live a happy life, then the rest of us, like the three of us.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F030.wav|Fine.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M001.wav|Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro06/Ses04M_impro06_M016.wav|I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F041.wav|All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M000.wav|Have you tried, uh, Craig's List?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro08/Ses05F_impro08_F020.wav|You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro03/Ses03F_impro03_F023.wav|Oh, maybe. I don't know. I've been there so many times. I think it's--we're going to get married in Spain and then we're going to get married here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_F012.wav|I know.  I know.  I'm- I'm definitely -- I realize [LAUGHTER].

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_F014.wav|Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you can sure be ambiguous sometimes, you know?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M044.wav|I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro06/Ses01M_impro06_M015.wav|It's just really weird because he was really young you know and it kind of like...

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M032.wav|So what if- what if we- what if we do three forms

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_M003.wav|It must be them then.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_M073.wav|Yeah.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro01/Ses03M_impro01_F003.wav|No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M025.wav|Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F004.wav|There's people that have given more though, you know?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro06/Ses01F_impro06_F023.wav|Umm. Yeah.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F012.wav|Well that sounds like your fault.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M018.wav|No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro05/Ses01M_impro05_M019.wav|You mean did someone steal it? Do people steal bags?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro02/Ses01M_impro02_M008.wav|I can't believe it. I just got back.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M014.wav|That's it? Okay, yeah.  What else?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_F013.wav|Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F015.wav|Not like that you're not.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F014.wav|To you it is and to me, but not to him.  I mean, you can talk yourself blue in the face, but he--there's no body and no grave so where are you?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_M026.wav|Give me the browns.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_F039.wav|He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_F002.wav|Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_2/Ses03M_script01_2_M016.wav|Look at you, you're shaking.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F007.wav|I would have thought you would have told me that you were planning on doing this.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_F000.wav|About what?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_F002.wav|Wow.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_M040.wav|No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro07/Ses04M_impro07_F032.wav|Maybe one of those megaphones. Pompom.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M047.wav|I don't know, just seemed like such a good spot to me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_M029.wav|You know, you don't have to take out your frustration on me, you know, just because...
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M011.wav|I think I'll have a little.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_F017.wav|Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_F006.wav|Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M028.wav|For instance, there was this time, and it had been raining for several days, and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks, just put them in my pocket.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_2/Ses05F_script01_2_M017.wav|What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_M013.wav|Well maybe yeah, but maybe you get to that point where it's like you bug 'em and then they just don't wanna hear from you anymore, but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then it's gonna annoy them so much that they're gonna be like all right fine. you know
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro07/Ses04M_impro07_M022.wav|'Cause, you know, it's like you get to know a lot of people in the dorms and.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M027.wav|What?  What do you want a divorce?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_M018.wav|I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F031.wav|Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F025.wav|No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F029.wav|So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.

No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_2/Ses04F_script03_2_M015.wav|Nothing.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M042.wav|I know that.  Just you help me stay here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_F013.wav|Um- I'm gonna be studying at U.S.C., too.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M029.wav|I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_F028.wav|I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_M019.wav|Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F020.wav|When do you leave?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M004.wav|Then why is that fair?  Why--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05b/Ses03M_impro05b_F027.wav|Yes sir, Yes.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_F001.wav|What do you mean. He couldn't have seen it. I was the first one up, he was still in bed.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_2/Ses04M_script01_2_F016.wav|Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F020.wav|Now, you can go on with this if you know where to go, but I don't know where to go.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_M032.wav|It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_F009.wav|I'm bored with this conversation.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro01/Ses04F_impro01_F000.wav|Hi.  Um, excuse me I've been to, like, five of the desks here and nobody seems to be able to tell me what it is I need to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  Can you possibly help me?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_M012.wav|Look, honey, it's- it's- it's only going to be a year.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_1/Ses05F_script03_1_F031.wav|Oh, ridiculous. utterly ridiculous
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_F020.wav|Oh my God.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M008.wav|Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F029.wav|So Congratulations. That's awesome.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_M031.wav|If I don't get to see it now, I get to see it later at least, you know?  You've got to keep it all for me; all right?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F032.wav|But you have a business here.  What the hell is this?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M037.wav|I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M044.wav|About all of that, about all I was talking about.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M036.wav|I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_M016.wav|Well, they tip well.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_F032.wav|What the hell is this?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_1/Ses03M_script02_1_F011.wav|Not particularly.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro06/Ses01M_impro06_M004.wav|God I've told this story so many times. Umm.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F010.wav|Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F022.wav|Have you asked Annie yet?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05b/Ses03M_impro05b_M017.wav|I need you to help me out here.  Can you get on the phone and get the luggage over on the fastest flight you can and then maybe I won't get you fired.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro07/Ses03M_impro07_M002.wav|Guess who got into U.S.C.?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_F021.wav|It wouldn't work this way.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M010.wav|I can't.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F019.wav|What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_M024.wav|Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F041.wav|Augie, you brought refreshments.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F023.wav|And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F004.wav|Uh-huh.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M000.wav|So what do you think?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F030.wav|Very much sillier.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro05/Ses01F_impro05_M034.wav|If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F026.wav|It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro07/Ses05F_impro07_F030.wav|[LAUGHTER] by yourself.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F029.wav|You never did.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F000.wav|Oh my God.  Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_M002.wav|Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro06/Ses05F_impro06_F014.wav|Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M021.wav|No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_F017.wav|Look, do you remember the first time we came here?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F042.wav|Well, then we don't need glasses.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_F001.wav|What?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F012.wav|So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F009.wav|[LAUGHTER]
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_F023.wav|okay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F017.wav|Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M029.wav|What? Huh?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F018.wav|Well that's nobody's business but yours, Chris.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_F025.wav|yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F000.wav|Did you get the mail? So you saw my letter?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_M002.wav|It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M037.wav|The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_M000.wav|Yeah, that kind of went out of style didn't it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_F018.wav|Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_F032.wav|I mean this is a lot of things, but it's just...
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M043.wav|Well, so what do you think?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro03/Ses03F_impro03_M005.wav|yeah [LAUGHTER]

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_1/Ses01M_script03_1_F031.wav|Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_F043.wav|Yeah, I can see that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F001.wav|What about like a temp agency?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_F008.wav|It's just so frustrating.  Like, I just--I just don't wanna do it anymore.  You know?  I just don't wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time.  You know, it's just like--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_F028.wav|That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro08/Ses05F_impro08_F018.wav|Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_F008.wav|I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_F013.wav|It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro04/Ses04F_impro04_F032.wav|Well maybe you could be a little helpful.  I mean obviously you don't have any problems so would it really take so much time out of your day to just go ahead and help somebody else.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M007.wav|Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M017.wav|Why didn't you?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M003.wav|Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F010.wav|I don't know why you'd want any, you've already had three glasses.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M033.wav|I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F007.wav|Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M008.wav|I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_M020.wav|Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M008.wav|I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M036.wav|Just please, will you please just work with me here? Just -- all I'm asking you to do is just work with me. I know -- I know that you get lots of people all day long who give you shit, give you crap, but
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_F004.wav|For one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_1/Ses03M_script02_1_M031.wav|And last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didn't even notice it until we got in the car.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro02/Ses05F_impro02_F027.wav|I know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M010.wav|Well, we'll see them this year.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro07/Ses02F_impro07_M003.wav|Are you gonna go? you gonna-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_2/Ses05F_script01_2_M000.wav|Why does that bother you?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro02/Ses05F_impro02_F032.wav|You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M004.wav|I don't care then.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro02/Ses04F_impro02_F005.wav|Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M021.wav|It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro07/Ses01M_impro07_F016.wav|Oh yeah. He'd drop you right off at practice?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M027.wav|Because it is.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro06/Ses03M_impro06_F014.wav|Yeah.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_F019.wav|I'm just worried.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_M023.wav|Oh.  That reply has broken my heart.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F030.wav|And very much sillier.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_F029.wav|How ridiculous. How utterly, utterly ridiculous.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_F003.wav|Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_F036.wav|You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_F054.wav|Right
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F001.wav|I'm getting married.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_M013.wav|I don't have -- I know.  What are we gonna- What are we- just run away?  What can I do?  Where can we go?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro07/Ses05F_impro07_M003.wav|So you're not going to leave me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M004.wav|The flashlight; the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_F046.wav|Augie, I'm sorry.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_M003.wav|I'm going to need it again.  I need to look at your file.  If you want me to look at your file--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F029.wav|How many?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F017.wav|'Cause you started to write me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro03/Ses03F_impro03_M016.wav|So where- where- where is this--have you talked about where it's going to be?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M011.wav|No particular reason. Anyhow, they are very small ones.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro04/Ses04F_impro04_M029.wav|Well you're going to have to.  You don't really have an option.  What's your problem?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M023.wav|You want to get some champagne?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M000.wav|He saw it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_2/Ses04M_script01_2_M009.wav|You can't read her mind.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_1/Ses02F_script03_1_F004.wav|It was bound to come sooner or later.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script03_2/Ses02F_script03_2_M024.wav|Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro05/Ses01M_impro05_F013.wav|Four...Four hours ago.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_1/Ses04F_script03_1_M000.wav|Good God.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F002.wav|When?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F008.wav|Why not?  You could, at least, try.  They have to understand
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro07/Ses05F_impro07_M013.wav|Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_F027.wav|This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_1/Ses02M_script03_1_M016.wav|No, that desire will fade along with our passion.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M016.wav|So you take things from me and you expect me just to wait around.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F010.wav|What you mean dishonest?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro02/Ses01M_impro02_M020.wav|I know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_F008.wav|Just, you know, kicking myself.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_F033.wav|What else?  I can't -- uh.  I'm drawing a blank here.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_M001.wav|I got it.  I got accepted to U.S.C..
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro01/Ses02M_impro01_M000.wav|All right. Finally. Here you go.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_F012.wav|Oh. Grow up Augie, the fish are not going to come.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro08/Ses05F_impro08_M032.wav|bye
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro07/Ses01F_impro07_F005.wav|I know. We should throw a party.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_F001.wav|I [GARBAGE]
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M018.wav|You felt something that far back?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro07/Ses01M_impro07_F033.wav|You're like the rookie? The new kid.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F032.wav|I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M033.wav|Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M000.wav|Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_M021.wav|Right I know, like you, it won't hurt, I mean national champions last year, wow, you know
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_F030.wav|Okay.  I haven't seen you in about two and a half years and I come back and you're getting engaged to somebody you only knew for
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M013.wav|Um- You know, window is nice. I guess
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro07/Ses02F_impro07_M020.wav|So what're you--what're you gonna do there?  Have you decided?  Thought about it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro06/Ses02M_impro06_F014.wav|It's going to be okay, I promise.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_1/Ses03F_script03_1_M014.wav|Who knows?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro02/Ses04F_impro02_M004.wav|And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_F017.wav|Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_F006.wav|Yeah, but maybe--if just because it's competitive, like maybe I'm just not good enough.  Maybe the level is here and I'm here and there's just no way I'm ever gonna do that--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M019.wav|you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_M029.wav|Just about all.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro03/Ses04M_impro03_F024.wav|This is why men don't plan weddings. [LAUGHTER]
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_2/Ses05F_script01_2_M012.wav|Calm yourself.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F031.wav|And you still feel that way?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_M000.wav|So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_F024.wav|Thank you so much.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro04/Ses04F_impro04_M003.wav|I mean I don't know just go out and keep trying. Just-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_F023.wav|We will definitely keep an eye out for your bag. We will try to find it.  We will, you know, fill out the form for missing items.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F036.wav|Are you crazy?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M016.wav|You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_M006.wav|Oh my gosh.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_F021.wav|You got to tell me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M031.wav|Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro06/Ses03M_impro06_F009.wav|How are they?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_F026.wav|No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M030.wav|Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M022.wav|Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M000.wav|Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro01/Ses05M_impro01_M016.wav|Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_F011.wav|You started to write me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M023.wav|Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_F014.wav|Yeah. of course.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro05/Ses05M_impro05_M007.wav|People lose --

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_F001.wav|I'm positive.  They came from like another state.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro03/Ses01F_impro03_F010.wav|Oh.  I hadn't even thought about that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M011.wav|No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05b/Ses03M_impro05b_M030.wav|Okay.  And you're going to give me what for my inconvenience?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro06/Ses01F_impro06_M013.wav|Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro02/Ses03M_impro02_M027.wav|I know.  I know.  But they really need some good guys there.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M015.wav|I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_F020.wav|It's three years.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_M032.wav|'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_F012.wav|What would be the worst that would happen if they found you somewhere else?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro02/Ses02F_impro02_M005.wav|What if--maybe--what if, uh, we went somewhere over there?  I don't--I don't know--I--I need to figure something out for this because--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M014.wav|You know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_F016.wav|They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F042.wav|I know. I can't believe it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M001.wav|Actually I want to get a little further up the coast, get away from all like the lights and the people, but...  How are you doing?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro02/Ses05F_impro02_F003.wav|Yeah, um everything's fine so far. um
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M014.wav|Annie, why didn't you call me or tell me?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M034.wav|I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro02/Ses01M_impro02_M006.wav|I guess they can do it,
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_M027.wav|Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_F021.wav|Right, Exactly.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_F006.wav|Well, what of it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M001.wav|God, this great, isn't it? Like look at the night we go here, it couldn't be better.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro06/Ses05M_impro06_M002.wav|The end, he's been sick for awhile.  He had cancer.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M002.wav|Right.  Well.  We still need it.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro03/Ses04M_impro03_M002.wav|Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_3/Ses05F_script01_3_F003.wav|No.  But I'm not going to stay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro04/Ses01M_impro04_M002.wav|It's not fair.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_M032.wav|Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_M023.wav|I wanted to get this settled first.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_F025.wav|Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M028.wav|But if I could just speak directly -- if I could just speak directly to your-- to your superior person
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_M038.wav|I like to think so.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro03/Ses01M_impro03_M009.wav|Have you?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_F040.wav|I know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_F037.wav|I mean, this is, this is everything, and it's a lot, but
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_F004.wav|You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_F025.wav|She said sure?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_M010.wav|We've got to say it to him.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_2/Ses04F_script03_2_F005.wav|What of it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_F014.wav|Do be quiet.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_M042.wav|Oh I know, I know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_2/Ses02M_script01_2_M006.wav|All right. Now, listen kid-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_M008.wav|Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M015.wav|I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M033.wav|It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro07/Ses01F_impro07_F011.wav|Um, yeah, yeah.  I'm a TA for two sessions. Mmhmm.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F025.wav|Then what?  Chris.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_3/Ses04M_script01_3_M001.wav|So you're not sorry you came?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M018.wav|uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro02/Ses01M_impro02_F001.wav|When?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_1/Ses05F_script03_1_F020.wav|Well, that's rather serious, isn't it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_1/Ses04F_script03_1_M021.wav|No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_M028.wav|For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F031.wav|You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_F017.wav|I was waiting for you Chris, I mean, till then you never wrote and then when you did what did you say?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M034.wav|No.  I know.  Me neither.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro05/Ses01F_impro05_M030.wav|Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F031.wav|Well, that's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.  I mean, you've been away for--at war.  It's been five years.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro06/Ses04F_impro06_M004.wav|Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_3/Ses04F_script01_3_F000.wav|You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro06/Ses04M_impro06_F016.wav|Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_M018.wav|Of course, you're worried.  We're all worried.  I'm worried for you.  Everyone's always worried.  You know, I don't-maybe I have a job and yeah, it's a good job whatever and I'm happy, but it doesn't mean I'm going to have it tomorrow or the next day.  You never know what's going to happen.  Something crazy could happen tomorrow.	Something crazy can happen for you tomorrow and you'll get a job.  You never know.  You can walk up to somebody on the street and it'll be something great.  You've just got to be positive.  You're so negative all the time.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_F011.wav|Not particularly.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro05/Ses04F_impro05_F019.wav|Okay.  Well I want to call whoever you report to, whoever your boss is because I have had enough with this airline and I am finished waiting for my fifty dollar gift certificate.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_F007.wav|I knew they would, your mother anyway.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro03/Ses01F_impro03_M023.wav|[LAUGHTER] Cat babies.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M039.wav|I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_M020.wav|I need you to tell me because I really need to get the bag, okay?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F025.wav|This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_1/Ses04F_script02_1_F021.wav|About what?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script03_2/Ses03F_script03_2_M030.wav|Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_M004.wav|Okay.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_1/Ses02M_script01_1_F008.wav|What?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_2/Ses03F_script01_2_F012.wav|I think again, that I'm-I'm right.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script03_2/Ses01M_script03_2_M003.wav|However, I do believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_M032.wav|I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.

So, I wanted her to climb it to go take a picture, like, back in this little waterfall area, and she got back there and she took her picture. And then, I had her come back.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F026.wav|Difficult.  You're leaving for a year. We have a newborn child and you're leaving.  I don't think I'm being difficult.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F015.wav|Oh, totally totally.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_1/Ses01F_script01_1_F013.wav|It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_3/Ses02F_script01_3_M028.wav|They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro04/Ses04F_impro04_M031.wav|I'm trying to be helpful.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F001.wav|It's ridiculous.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_F035.wav|I cannot believe you.  Why do you want to get married?  You're a boy.  You're a little boy.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_M026.wav|We weren't in a good spot.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro03/Ses05M_impro03_M011.wav|And she's like- she feels it you know and she doesn't know what it is.  And she you know helps me get out and I won't let go of her hand.  And she's like, what are you doing?  I and said, You saved my life, now will you marry me?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro02/Ses02M_impro02_M005.wav|A little family.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro02/Ses03M_impro02_M017.wav|I don't want to - I don't- I don't want to go.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro07/Ses02F_impro07_M009.wav|Fight on.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro04/Ses03F_impro04_F004.wav|So I'll have to wait twenty five years-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M026.wav|this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_F026.wav|But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro03/Ses03M_impro03_F011.wav|Okay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F015.wav|Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro07/Ses05F_impro07_F027.wav|oh yeah.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_1/Ses04F_script03_1_F007.wav|Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F026.wav|It went on intermittently for days.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_M013.wav|So, um- so what are you going to- what are you going to major in?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_F055.wav|and like most places really.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_M008.wav|I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M017.wav|Of course not.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro04/Ses01F_impro04_F018.wav|I just don't want this paper trail, you know.  I just don't want things following me around, like-.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_F025.wav|Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M043.wav|Shh.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M019.wav|Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_F018.wav|Well, I haven't decided yet.  I want to try some things out.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro05/Ses04F_impro05_F002.wav|I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M001.wav|You're not sorry you came?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_2/Ses05F_script03_2_M002.wav|I remember it well, covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_1/Ses03M_script02_1_M008.wav|Well, sure.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M019.wav|You know it's not only my business.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_F047.wav|I know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_1/Ses04F_script01_1_F017.wav|Well I got an idea but what's the story?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M011.wav|And you couldn't find it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_M019.wav|So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F000.wav|Do you think it's them?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro05/Ses05M_impro05_M009.wav|You know, this is actually, I mean it's -- it's a really important piece of luggage.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_F005.wav|What's going on here, Joe?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_M000.wav|He saw it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro08/Ses02F_impro08_M007.wav|All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F003.wav|I'm not sorry, no. But I'm...I can't stay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro05/Ses04F_impro05_F014.wav|You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_M016.wav|I mean, You can tell me what.  Why is no one hiring me?  Is it me?  Be honest.  You can tell me. you know I can take it.  I can take it, you just tell me. Why?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_2/Ses02F_script02_2_F029.wav|This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_F008.wav|[LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_1/Ses05F_script03_1_M023.wav|I don't mind what you do, see, you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the Place Vendome and run off with every man in the world.  And I shan't say a word as long as I know that you love me best.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro07/Ses03M_impro07_M003.wav|Me. Yeah, I did.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro08/Ses05F_impro08_M023.wav|Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro04/Ses01M_impro04_M008.wav|No, well maybe it's because I'm like frustrated 'cause I can't get a job, you know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1/Ses05M_script01_1_F012.wav|how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro01/Ses05F_impro01_F014.wav|No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_F020.wav|I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F009.wav|Well, it's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_M036.wav|Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro05/Ses01F_impro05_M005.wav|Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_M035.wav|Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro07/Ses02F_impro07_F015.wav|Like, now that I'm accepted, it's just, like, such a huge load off my mind.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro02/Ses01F_impro02_M016.wav|It's just not fair.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M027.wav|Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M013.wav|Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_2/Ses03F_script02_2_M038.wav|Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_2/Ses02M_script02_2_M011.wav|I thought you wanted to see them.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M037.wav|And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_3/Ses03M_script01_3_M042.wav|And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro01/Ses05M_impro01_F017.wav|I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro04/Ses04M_impro04_F018.wav|You see what you just did there, though?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M020.wav|It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M036.wav|Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?

And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_1/Ses04M_script02_1_M025.wav|I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro02/Ses04F_impro02_M003.wav|I mean we both knew that this was going to happen.  It's just that I feel that, you know, I don't want Susie growing up without a mother.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_F019.wav|We didn't see them the first time either.
