../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_F038.wav|Yeah.  Don't you know that?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_1/Ses01M_script01_1_M011.wav|I don't want to argue with him, it's just for God's sake it's time he realized that no one believes with him any more.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_F003.wav|It's ours; it's mine too.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_F003.wav|Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro04/Ses05M_impro04_F007.wav|Really?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro07/Ses03F_impro07_M001.wav|I'm all right.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro06/Ses03F_impro06_F007.wav|He was amazing.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M001.wav|On what airline?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M003.wav|We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M009.wav|Me, too, bored stiff.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_F026.wav|Do you still feel that way?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script02_1/Ses03F_script02_1_M001.wav|Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_F043.wav|Augie, you bought refreshments.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro01/Ses05F_impro01_F018.wav|Why not?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro03/Ses01M_impro03_F024.wav|Incredible.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M002.wav|It certainly is not.  It's a slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_M034.wav|I've been a good son for too long, a big sucker.  I'm through with it.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro07/Ses02F_impro07_M033.wav|But it's LA, you know, everything.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script02_1/Ses02F_script02_1_M027.wav|Yeah they do.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M045.wav|Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_F018.wav|That's rather serious, isn't it?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_1/Ses01M_script02_1_F013.wav|That's my point.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro04/Ses05F_impro04_F028.wav|Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_2/Ses05M_script01_2_M003.wav|Why do you think he's even thinking that?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro03/Ses01F_impro03_M008.wav|Yeah.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro03/Ses01M_impro03_F003.wav|Is she on the run?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_F008.wav|That's so cool.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro06/Ses01F_impro06_F020.wav|It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_F026.wav|It went on intermittently for days.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro07/Ses02F_impro07_F017.wav|Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script01_3/Ses01M_script01_3_M035.wav|You know.  I went to work with dad and I started that whole rat race again...

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M006.wav|And what about me?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_F003.wav|And very much sillier.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_2/Ses04F_script03_2_M016.wav|Going somewhere, my dear?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_F023.wav|So when do you know, like, where you're gonna live? and-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08a/Ses03M_impro08a_F012.wav|No, no, no...  I'm done with these contract business because this is what can happen.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro04/Ses01M_impro04_F019.wav|I can't finish the sentence with you without you jumping in...
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro08/Ses04M_impro08_F002.wav|Uh. Yeah, I just gave it to the automated thing like five times.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_F002.wav|Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F008.wav|Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F008.wav|He's getting just like after he died.  What is the meaning of that?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro02/Ses03F_impro02_M017.wav|You can't postpone it?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro07/Ses05M_impro07_F015.wav|Yeah.  Totally- Well where are you going to live?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro02/Ses03M_impro02_M013.wav|We'll have internet set up, we'll get web cameras and everything.  My whole family's here too.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_2/Ses04F_script03_2_M019.wav|Yes, it is.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_M035.wav|This is no time of the year for Tunis.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro03/Ses02F_impro03_F015.wav|I know. So we're gonna take it--Like we're not gonna get married right away--'Cause we want to like have plenty of time to plan everything out
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_F003.wav|No I didn't, you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_F001.wav|It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M027.wav|Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro08/Ses02M_impro08_F022.wav|Yes, absolutely.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F020.wav|all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_M084.wav|Yes, you're right.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_1/Ses05M_script03_1_M025.wav|Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M002.wav|About four in the morning.  I heard a crack and I looked out and he was standing right there when it happened.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_F021.wav|Thank you dear.  The same applies to you...
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_F001.wav|It's not so bad; it's a good thing.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M023.wav|Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M032.wav|Yes, it is.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_F028.wav|Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_3/Ses05M_script01_3_M041.wav|Oh, Annie,
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro07/Ses04M_impro07_M007.wav|Yeah.  I like to know about history, 'cause, you know, it's- it's just so relevant to the present.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script01_2/Ses04F_script01_2_F002.wav|Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F014.wav|We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_F032.wav|And you still feel that way?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro05/Ses03F_impro05_M014.wav|What, do you have questions?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_1/Ses04M_script03_1_M031.wav|Ah, I shall never forget his face.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro04/Ses02F_impro04_M011.wav|... and there's no reason that--that something won't come up like really soon.  All right?  So you just gotta--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_2/Ses01F_script03_2_F028.wav|Shut up.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_2/Ses03M_script03_2_M039.wav|Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro02/Ses03M_impro02_F033.wav|I need you here.  Anna needs you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro01/Ses04F_impro01_F021.wav|I don't need to be.  I need to go and do other things with my time.  Okay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M005.wav|Yes, I guess I have been. But it's going from me now.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_2/Ses02F_script01_2_M015.wav|What?- Why- Why me above all?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_impro07/Ses01F_impro07_M006.wav|A rapper party ho. Yeah. Okay.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script02_1/Ses02M_script02_1_M032.wav|And then last year I remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house, and you didn't even notice until we got in the car.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro04/Ses03M_impro04_M038.wav|Same difference.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro01/Ses05M_impro01_F000.wav|Can I help you?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro01/Ses02M_impro01_M017.wav|That doesn't make any sense. Why?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro07/Ses05F_impro07_M033.wav|That's a good idea.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro01/Ses03F_impro01_F005.wav|Excuse me? No, no. I waited in the line over there..
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M017.wav|Okay, so you think you're going to-  -get me back some minutes, and that's going to make up for three days of business that I lost?  Okay, great.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro04/Ses03M_impro04_F003.wav|Well what are you looking for?  I mean--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro05/Ses01M_impro05_F027.wav|What was that?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script03_2/Ses04M_script03_2_M049.wav|You're a vile tempered, loosed living
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M013.wav|No, of course not.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_F011.wav|I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro05a/Ses03M_impro05a_F016.wav|Okay.  We will find your luggage.  Apparently because it somehow...what flight you were taking, you were on Delta?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script03_2/Ses05M_script03_2_F011.wav|Well, it seems silly to go on and on with such a thing.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro02/Ses05F_impro02_M002.wav|Are you all right?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_F003.wav|What was he doing out here at four in the morning?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_F014.wav|Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script03_2/Ses04F_script03_2_M025.wav|I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_1/Ses04M_script01_1_M032.wav|Yeah, let's keep going.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_M014.wav|Well, the weekends are not as busy.  Maybe you can uh, come and try to get here early--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F025.wav|I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro03/Ses04M_impro03_M008.wav|Yeah. Yeah. So- I know.  I know. I know.  It's weird 'cause it's like the beginning of the rest of my life, you know.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro05/Ses02M_impro05_F003.wav|Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro02/Ses05M_impro02_M000.wav|Sweetheart, I've got to tell you something.  I just got a call.  I'm going to Iraq.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro06/Ses05M_impro06_M020.wav|Thanks.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_script02_2/Ses04F_script02_2_M011.wav|We've missed them twice that's not ever.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script01_1/Ses05F_script01_1_F022.wav|As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro05/Ses04M_impro05_M029.wav|then that would be helpful to me because I just feel like if- you don't think you have the power to write three checks but you actually do. see?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script01_3/Ses01F_script01_3_M025.wav|It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro05/Ses01M_impro05_F022.wav|No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro08a/Ses03M_impro08a_F005.wav|Olivia.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro04/Ses04F_impro04_F000.wav|That's helpful.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro05/Ses03F_impro05_F016.wav|Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_1/Ses03F_script01_1_M034.wav|Because it is.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro07/Ses02F_impro07_M017.wav|Right.  Right.  Right. Oh, man, then you're going to have to do orientation, I guess.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script01_1b/Ses05M_script01_1b_F021.wav|Well, you're a considerate fella.  There's nothing wrong with that.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_M044.wav|You know that I've never-I- I have a long run of bad relationships but, you know, I mean, you got to work through it.  It's fine.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_F003.wav|I don't have the form.  You're going to have to go get in that line over there and they will give you the right form.  And after you fill it out, you can bring it back to me.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro01/Ses02F_impro01_F004.wav|I mean it just says that you need some form of identification, but it doesn't say what kind of identification.

They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_2/Ses05F_script02_2_F010.wav|No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro07/Ses05F_impro07_M011.wav|But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_F015.wav|Not particularly.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro07/Ses02M_impro07_M011.wav|it was good, yeah. I mean-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M016.wav|Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_impro07/Ses01M_impro07_M005.wav|Yeah, everything. Every like- free ride and I get to, you know, like be on like a Trojans sports team too. And it's like cool. Isn't it awesome?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M037.wav|I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro05/Ses05F_impro05_M043.wav|Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro03/Ses02M_impro03_M006.wav|I know Uhm- I can't believe it.  It's like-
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script01_1/Ses03M_script01_1_M029.wav|Then I guess that's the end of it.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_script01_1/Ses02F_script01_1_M038.wav|Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script02_1/Ses05F_script02_1_M012.wav|you want my jacket?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script03_1/Ses01F_script03_1_M022.wav|No, no, no, no. no.  Death is a very laughable thing.  It's a cunning little mystery, it's all done with mirrors.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_impro03/Ses05F_impro03_F008.wav|Right, I thought I would be way older too. I thought I would be I be at least thirty something.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_impro04/Ses03M_impro04_F028.wav|Well obviously it's not working.  Just cause you got sixteen hundred on your S.A.T. doesn't guarantee you a job.  I mean it should really but--
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_1/Ses05M_script02_1_M028.wav|Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02F_impro05/Ses02F_impro05_M021.wav|Yes, all right.  There you go, now you can file a claim over to the left--And they'll help you out.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script03_2/Ses02M_script03_2_M047.wav|I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_impro08/Ses03F_impro08_M021.wav|About three million dollars.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script03_1/Ses03M_script03_1_M004.wav|I don't care then.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro02/Ses04M_impro02_F013.wav|Well unagree.  Tell them that you can't leave right now.  I can't do this by myself.  I can't do this without you.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script01_2/Ses04M_script01_2_M007.wav|Line.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05F_script03_2/Ses05F_script03_2_M008.wav|Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M011.wav|I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03M_script02_2/Ses03M_script02_2_M003.wav|I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01M_script02_2/Ses01M_script02_2_M035.wav|You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_script02_2/Ses04M_script02_2_M033.wav|Right.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_script01_3/Ses02M_script01_3_M005.wav|The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_script02_2/Ses05M_script02_2_M024.wav|Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?

../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_2/Ses01F_script02_2_F045.wav|I'm beginning to think this might be the right spot after all.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04M_impro01/Ses04M_impro01_M007.wav|But you're -- it's the same -- I mean, you can -- like I can't go behind your desk--

../iemocap/iemocap/Session3/sentences/wav/Ses03F_script01_3/Ses03F_script01_3_M004.wav|What?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro03/Ses04F_impro03_F051.wav|[LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.

../iemocap/iemocap/Session4/sentences/wav/Ses04F_impro07/Ses04F_impro07_M003.wav|You serious?
../iemocap/iemocap/Session1/sentences/wav/Ses01F_script02_1/Ses01F_script02_1_M032.wav|And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.
../iemocap/iemocap/Session2/sentences/wav/Ses02M_impro04/Ses02M_impro04_M008.wav|Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like

../iemocap/iemocap/Session5/sentences/wav/Ses05M_impro08/Ses05M_impro08_F022.wav|Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.

And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?
